                Well done developers, I did not see such a game except as "Tank
                a lot". I put five out of five, because the game has good

              roulette of luck where you could drop crystals from 10 to 50,
              gold(that is coins), tickets, and also skins or passives with
              gadgets. Well, so the game is very good.
